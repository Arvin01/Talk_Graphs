## Talk on &ldquo;How to display data badly&rdquo;


These are slides for a talk that I give as often as possible, because
it's fun.

This was inspired by Howard Wainer's article, whose title I stole:
[H Wainer (1984) How to display data badly American Statistician
38:137-147](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~roos/Courses/grstat502/wainer.pdf)


A recent PDF is
